## Fear & Greed Index Stock Market Analysis

This project analyzes how stock market sentiment—measured by the Fear & Greed Index—relates to real trading results. Using Python, it merges and visualizes market emotion with historical trade outcomes.

## Features

- Combines Fear & Greed Index values with daily trading data
- Produces key data visualizations (scatter plot, bar chart, time-series, histogram)
- Saves processed results and graphs for review

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn


## Usage

   - `Fear_greed_Index.csv` (sentiment data)
   - `Historical_Data.csv` (trading data)
   
2. Run the program:


3. Graphs and merged results will appear in a folder called `plots`.

## Outputs

- `.png` images: visualizations of PnL and sentiment relationships
